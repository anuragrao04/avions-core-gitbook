# The Recruitment Process

The most important part of making sure this club has a future is recruitments. When you're recruiting, you look for people who you think could be the future core team of this club. While our club has started small in size over the past 2 years, this year, we have around 40 members. I'm sure this number is only going to grow and ofc not all of these people would end up being in the core team. However, it's a good heuristic to aim for.&#x20;
