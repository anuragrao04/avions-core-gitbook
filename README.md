# Introduction

Avions is the Aero Modelling club of PES University Electronic City Campus. We build shit that flies.

This documentation is all about how to run the Avions Club. It's meant for the future core team of this club. It contains policies, history, and a few common patterns we find while dealing with competitions, people, and the university.

While the content is specific to Avions, you can apply the same knowledge in leading other clubs, and possibly even other teams.\

This was first drafted by Avions Core 2024-2025 and we hope you enjoy reading it.
